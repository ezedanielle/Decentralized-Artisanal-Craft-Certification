# Decentralized Artisanal Craft Certification

A blockchain-based system for certifying and authenticating artisanal crafts through transparent verification of craftspeople, techniques, materials, and finished products.

## Overview

This project creates a decentralized infrastructure for artisanal craft certification, empowering craftspeople to authenticate their work and providing consumers with verifiable information about the provenance, techniques, and materials used in handcrafted items.

The system uses smart contracts to create a trustless certification process that maintains the integrity of traditional craftsmanship while bringing authentic artisanal products into the digital economy.

## Core Components

### 1. Craftsperson Registration Contract

Records verifiable information about skilled artisans including:
- Identity verification
- Craft specialization and expertise
- Training history and lineage
- Geographical location and cultural context
- Experience timeline and portfolio references

### 2. Technique Verification Contract

Validates that traditional methods and skills are properly employed:
- Documentation of specific techniques and processes
- Peer validation from master craftspeople
- Historical references to traditional methods
- Time-tracking for labor-intensive techniques
- Quality assessment metrics

### 3. Material Sourcing Contract

Tracks the origin and authenticity of raw materials:
- Supply chain verification for material origins
- Sustainability and ethical sourcing metrics
- Material quality specifications
- Traditional/regional material authenticity
- Quantity tracking and waste reduction

### 4. Authenticity Certification Contract

Issues verifiable credentials for completed handmade items:
- Unique digital certificates for each piece
- Combination of all previous contract verifications
- Photographic documentation at production stages
- Creation timeline validation
- Ownership transfer and provenance history

## Benefits

- **For Craftspeople**: Protects traditional techniques, verifies authenticity, builds reputation, and provides fair compensation for skilled work
- **For Consumers**: Ensures transparency in sourcing and production, validates authenticity, and connects purchases to cultural heritage
- **For Markets**: Reduces fraud, creates price differentiation for authentic goods, and preserves cultural heritage

## Technical Implementation

- Built on [specify blockchain platform]
- Smart contracts written in [programming language]
- Uses decentralized storage for media documentation
- Integration with physical verification mechanisms (optional)
- Mobile-friendly verification interface for buyers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [List technical prerequisites]

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-craft-certification.git

# Install dependencies
cd decentralized-craft-certification
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Configure your blockchain connection in `config.js`
2. Set up your development environment with appropriate keys

### Deployment
```bash
# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Craftsperson
```javascript
// Example code for craftsperson registration
const craftspersonRegistry = await CraftspersonRegistry.deploy();
await craftspersonRegistry.registerCraftsperson(
  "0x123...", // Craftsperson wallet address
  "Traditional Weaver", // Craft type
  "ipfs://QmX...", // Documentation hash
  regionCode, // Geographic identifier
  certificationLevel // Experience level
);
```

### Issuing a Certificate
```javascript
// Example code for creating a certificate
const certificate = await AuthenticityContract.createCertificate(
  craftspersonId,
  productId,
  materialsVerificationHash,
  techniqueVerificationHash,
  productDocumentationHash
);
```

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial contract deployment and testing
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile verification app development
- **Q4 2025**: Integration with marketplace platforms
- **Q1 2026**: Implementation of governance mechanisms for community standards
